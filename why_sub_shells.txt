In the context of a shell like Bash, whether a command is executed in the same environment (the parent process) or in a child environment (a forked process) depends on the type of command and its behavior. Here's a breakdown:

When to Execute in the Same Environment (Parent Process):
Built-in Commands:

Commands that are part of the shell itself (e.g., cd, export, unset, exit, etc.) need to modify the shell's state (e.g., change directories, update environment variables, or terminate the shell).
These commands are executed in the same environment because they directly affect the shell's state.
Examples:

cd /path/to/dir (changes the current working directory of the shell).
export VAR=value (modifies the shell's environment variables).
exit (terminates the shell).
Special Syntax:

Control structures like if, while, for, and case are part of the shell's syntax and are executed in the same environment.
Examples:

When to Execute in a Child Environment (Forked Process):
External Commands:

Any command that is not a shell built-in or part of the shell's syntax is executed as an external program. This requires forking a new process and using exec to replace the child process with the external program.
Examples:

ls, grep, cat, echo (if not a built-in), etc.
How it works:

The shell forks a new process.
The child process executes the external command.
The parent process waits for the child to finish (unless the command is run in the background).
Pipelines:

When using pipes (|), each command in the pipeline is executed in its own child process. The shell sets up the necessary redirections between the processes.
Example:

ls runs in one child process.
grep "file" runs in another child process.
Subshells:

Commands executed in a subshell (e.g., within parentheses () or using $(...)) are run in a child process.
Examples:

Background Commands:

Commands run in the background (using &) are executed in a child process.
Example:

Key Differences Between Parent and Child Environments:
Parent Environment:

Changes persist after the command finishes (e.g., cd changes the shell's working directory).
Used for built-ins and commands that modify the shell's state.
Child Environment:

Changes do not affect the parent shell (e.g., cd in a subshell does not change the parent shell's directory).
Used for external commands, pipelines, and subshells.
How This Applies to Your Shell Implementation:
Built-in Commands:

Execute directly in the parent process (e.g., cd, export).
You can check if a command is a built-in and handle it without forking.
External Commands:

Fork a new process and execute the command in the child process using execve().
Pipelines:

Fork separate child processes for each command in the pipeline and connect their input/output using pipes.
Subshells:

Fork a new process for commands in parentheses or command substitution.
